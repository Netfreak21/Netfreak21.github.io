### Experience 

Intern at [Visa Inc.](https://www.visa.co.in)(May-July 2019)
* Implemented a distributed caching mechanism by using Hazelcast IMDG
and Redis to improve user experience by reducing the data retrieval time
from the traditional SQL Database to almost five folds. Implemented
solution as a service rather than being a part of the infrastructure.
* Created a bunch of REST APIs to populate the cache and utility APIs to get
insights into the memory consumption and cluster details.
* Created a generic framework which will help the developers to try any
caching solution for any use case by changing minimal amount of existing
code.
* Language - C#
Technologies - Hazelcast IMDG, Redis, .Net Core.
